# Note

This project only manages the "**Oracle Launcher V2**" database.

This "**Laravel**" project has been modified at the request of users to use "`/`" as document root instead of the
new "`/public`" standard. You can take advantage of the 2 systems, but I recommend the standard method for more
compatibility.
